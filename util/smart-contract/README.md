I'm using Sepolia as the testnet to deploy to, so be sure to have some eth on that testnet in the wallet.

Example deployed contract can be found here: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4dB6158A28326075fbEffC6C93CdD756F0D1193a

## To deploy:

1. Add .env file with variables:

```
RPC_URL=<node-rpc-url>
PRIVATE_KEY=<wallet-pk>
```

2. Run `yarn deploy`
